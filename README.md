# Fishin' Food Tweaks

You will need ModMenu and GlassConfigAPI if you want to tweak different parts of the mod. See installation instructions below.
* Mod now works on Multiplayer with GlassConfigAPI version 2.0+ used to sync configs!
* Mod has BHCreative creative mode support (adds a tab with unique fish to creative menu)

## List of changes

* Enable random fish sizes to catch fish of different lengths!
  * Every 10 cm of fish provides half a heart of health.
  * When fish is cooked very 5 cm of fish provides half a heart of health.
  * Achievements have also been added for catching small, ocean, and special fish!
* Enable fish healing tooltips to show healing amounts.
  * Enable food tooltips to show healing amounts for other foods as well.
* Enable oceanic fish to catch fish up to 110 cm in length.
  * Default fish sizes will be between 10 cm and 70 cm.
* Enable non-vanilla fish
  * Adds 4 new fish types to the game common, river, sea, and ocean (if ocean is enabled)
* Enable water surface calculations (default true)
  * More water makes bigger fish sizes slightly more likely (less water does the opposite)
  * Size of water surface area affects which non-vanilla fish types can be caught

# Fishin' Food Tweaks

You will need ModMenu and GlassConfigAPI if you want to tweak different parts of the mod. See installation instructions below.

**There's a very high chance this mod will not work in multiplayer, as of right now it is purely for singleplayer**

## List of changes

* Enable fish sizes to catch fish of different lengths!
  * Every 10 cm of fish (rounded) provides half a heart of health.
* Enable bigger fish to catch fish up to 110 cm in length.
  * Default fish sizes will be between 10 cm and 70 cm.
* Customize food tooltips to show healing amounts.
